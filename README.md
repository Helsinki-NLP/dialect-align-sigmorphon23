# Character alignment methods for phonetically transcribed dialect corpora

The code in this repo addresses the following task:

*Given a (dialectal) phonetic transcription and an orthographic normalization of an utterance, align the characters of the two layers.*

* `data`: The three datasets used in our experiments (SKN - Finnish, NDC - Norwegian, ArchiMob - Swiss German).
* `alignment`: The character alignment methods.
* `phrasetables`: The n-gram pairs extracted from the alignments.
* `extract_features`: Probability distributions and distance matrices for manually defined features.

An overview of the results can be found in our presentation at *Methods in Dialectology* 2022:
