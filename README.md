# Character alignment methods for dialect-to-standard normalization

The code in this repo addresses the following task:

*Given a (dialectal) phonetic transcription and an orthographic normalization of an utterance, align the characters of the two layers.*

* `data`: The three datasets used in our experiments (SKN - Finnish, NDC - Norwegian, ArchiMob - Swiss German).
* `alignment`: The character alignment methods.
